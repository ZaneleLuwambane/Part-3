            <p>Welcome to our foundation's web application.</p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to increase disaster response efficiency by allowing for faster
            communication, coordination, and resource deployment. It supports resource mobilization by
            connecting donors, non-governmental organizations, and government agencies with persons in need,
            allowing for the gathering and delivery of necessary goods and cash relief.
            The app also functions as a primary center for real-time information on ongoing catastrophes,
            such as weather updates, evacuation orders, emergency contact information, and safety advice and
            standards.
        </p><br /><br />

        <p>There are various disasters like: </p><br />
        <img src="Disaster2.png" alt="This Tornadoes are unpredictable and may inflict
considerable damage and loss of life, so if you live in a tornado-prone location,
you must take tornado warnings seriously and have a plan in place to protect yourself and your loved ones." 
        width="300" height="200"><br /><br />

        <p>Sandstorms, which are created by high winds, can have a substantial impact on visibility, health, 
            infrastructure, and the environment, especially in dry and desert areas. Effective mitigation and
            preparedness methods are critical for dealing with these issues.</p>
        <img src="SandStorm.jpg" alt="This is a picture of a sandstorm" width="150" height="150" /><br /><br />

        <p>Landslides are downhill movements of dirt and rock produced by natural or human-made events that have
            disastrous effects on populations and infrastructure, demanding preventative, monitoring, and
            mitigation measures to decrease hazards.</p>
            <img src="Disaster3.png" alt="Landslide" width="150" height="150" /><br /><br />

        <p>Tsunamis, massive ocean waves caused by underwater disturbances, pose a significant threat to coastlines, 
            necessitating early warning systems, preparedness measures, and international cooperation to mitigate their 
            impact and save lives.</p>
        <img src="Disaster4.jpg" alt="Tsunami" width="150" height="150" /><br /><br />


        <p>Volcanoes, which are generated by the explosion of molten rock under the Earth's surface, 
            are both dangerous and beneficial to human cultures and the environment. Monitoring and study are
            essential for comprehending and managing these dangers.</p>
